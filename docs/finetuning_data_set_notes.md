How to describe a finetuning dataset (dimensions to cover)
1) Purpose & fit

Target use-case: e.g., witty PG one-liners, customer support, coding help.

Style/tone: PG vs PG-13 vs R, formal vs casual, humor vs neutral.

Domain/topic coverage: general chit-chat, movies/entertainment, work/school, etc.

2) Structure & formatting

Unit: single turn vs multi-turn dialogues; average turns per convo.

Input/Output schema: keys (e.g., prompt/response), or chat roles (system/user/assistant).

Template: raw text vs instruction format vs tokenizer chat template.

Context length: avg/max tokens per input, per conversation.

3) Content quality & safety

Profanity/NSFW prevalence: blocked/filtered? allowed? (and why)

Violence/sexual content: kept, softened, or removed?

Toxicity/harassment: filtered rules + tools used (regex, classifiers).

Age appropriateness: PG / PG-13 / R.

4) Data hygiene

Deduplication: exact/fuzzy dedup methods, % removed.

Normalization: lowercasing, punctuation fixes, emoji handling, Unicode.

Cleaning: remove markup/artifacts, stage directions, HTML tags.

Leakage controls: ensured no overlap with eval/test or downstream benchmarks.

5) Coverage & balance

Topic distribution: e.g., small talk %, advice %, jokes %, etc.

Length distribution: histograms or percentiles for tokens/turns.

Speaker diversity: characters, genders, eras; note biases.

Temporal bias: older movies → outdated norms/slang; mention mitigation.

6) Splits & size

Counts: train/val/test examples; token totals.

Sampling strategy: random vs stratified (by length/topic/era).

7) Preprocess → train alignment

Exact training string: show one canonical example (prefix + response) as fed to the model.

Special tokens: BOS/EOS, system prompts, stop sequences.

Truncation rules: head/tail, windowing for long turns.

8) Legal & ethics

License/redistribution: what you can ship; derivatives allowed?

Attribution: dataset citation.

Known risks: stereotypes, offensive language; how you mitigated/messaged.

9) Evaluation plan

Automatic: perplexity on matched format, toxicity rate, safety triggers.

Human: A/B rubric (relevance, coherence, tone, format), sample size, seed control.

Example “dataset card” snippet you can reuse

Name: Cornell Movie Dialogs (processed)
Use-case: Cinematic small-talk and witty banter (PG-13)
Schema: JSONL with prompt (user) / response (assistant)
Template: Tokenizer apply_chat_template; system: “Be witty and cinematic…”
Scale: 90k train / 5k val / 5k test (~35M tokens total)
Turns: single-turn pairs (sampled from multi-turn with 2-turn window)
Length: median 16 tokens I/O; p95 64 tokens
Cleaning: dedup (MinHash, 3.8% removed); strip stage directions/markup; Unicode normalized
Safety: profanity/sexual/violence filtered to PG-13 (regex + small lexicons); explicit slurs removed
Bias notes: 20th-century US/UK pop-culture skew; gender stereotypes present; flagged in model card
License: dataset license notes + citation
Eval: PPL (chat+masked), toxicity rate (Perspective-lite or lexicon), human A/B on 200 prompts (wit/on-topic/PG)

If you keep Cornell as-is (no PG filtering)

Be explicit in your dataset card:

“Contains adult language and themes; intended for mature, cinematic dialogue generation; not for general assistant use.”

Provide inference guardrails (system prompt, decoding limits), or ship a PG variant trained on a cleaned subset if the target is broad users.

If you want, I can draft a ready-to-fill dataset card Markdown for your docs/ and a quick filtering script to produce a PG (or PG-13) subset.
